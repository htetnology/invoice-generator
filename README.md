# invoice-generator
This is a simple program that generates an invoice charging for work done on a particular project.

The invoice contains details about the client, vendor, project and costing information. Each set of details can be found in their respective class file. The invoice ID and date are also included.

As per coursework requirements, all of the classes (except Test) follow data encapsultation, each class has one task to perform and the invoice is correctly formatted. Test is the main class used to run the program. When the program runs successfully, the invoice is saved as a text file inside the project folder. Developed using Java and NetBeans IDE.
